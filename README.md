# 🚖 Uber Trip Analysis – Power BI Project

This repository contains a end-to-end Uber Trip Analysis project built using Power BI. The goal was to analyze Uber ride data to uncover trends in booking, revenue, and trip efficiency, and to present the insights through clean, interactive dashboards.

📌 Project Summary

Through this project, I explored real-world data preparation, dynamic measure creation, and advanced Power BI features such as bookmarks, drill-through, disconnected tables, and time-based heatmaps. The insights generated are aimed at enhancing Uber’s strategic decision-making around ride demand, vehicle utilization, and pricing optimization.

💡 Business Objectives

Analyze Uber trip data to discover patterns and trends.
Provide business stakeholders with actionable insights via dashboards.
Improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction through data-driven insights.

📊 Key Metrics (KPIs)

Total Bookings – Total number of trips completed.
Total Booking Value – Total revenue from bookings.
Average Booking Value – Revenue per booking.
Total Trip Distance – Total distance covered by all trips.
Average Trip Distance – Average distance per trip.
Average Trip Time – Average duration of trips.
